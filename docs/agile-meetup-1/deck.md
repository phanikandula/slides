Empiricism


 a theory that all knowledge originates in experience



Agile Principle #7


 Working software is the primary measure of progress. 



Vertical slicing


Vertical stories deliver a very thin slice of functionality that requires code that works across a product's architecture stack.



Advantages


Forces team to validate architecture before it is 'hardened'


Starts delivering value from first iteration.


Sets the team up for functional, integration and performance testing


Promotes evolutionary architecture.



Let's try to build an eCommerce site! 


Just a webpage with contact info.


Show a static list of products and a phone number to order.


Enable checkout of just one item at a time.


Add cart to checkout with multiple items.


Accept more than one payment options.



Ideas for more practice:
- Make facebook clone
- Make powerpoint clone

How would you slice the stories?
