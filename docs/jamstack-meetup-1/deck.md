JAMstack: noun \’jam-stak’\ 


Modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.



Stack?


LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP)


- Specific OS
- Webserver
- Database
- Programming language



Don't all websites use Javascript, API and Markup?


- Yes. But there are certain criteria for a site to be JAMStack



Javascript


- Client side 
- Any framework or library or vanilla JS
- Handles request and processing dynamic data



API


- Abstracts server side processes and/or database access.
- Accessed with JS over HTTP
- Your custom API or 3rd party API or both.



Markup


- Prebuilt at deploy time



Examples


- Smashing magazine - https://www.smashingmagazine.com/


- JAMStack Austin - https://www.jamstackaustin.com/


- This slide deck - http://phanikandula.com/slides/jamstack-meetup-1



Benefits?


- Better performance


Pre-built sites served over CDN (Content Devliery Network)


- Cheaper, Easier scaling


Deployment is just bunch of files that can be served from anywhere.


- Higher Security


APIs abstract business logic and database access.


- Better developer experience


Loose coupling and separation of controls of content generation, build and deployment.



Which websites are not JAMStack?


- Sites built with server side CMS 


Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal etc


- Single page apps with Isomorphic rendering


Views are built on server side at run time.


- Monolithic webapps
