About you

## Why self host?
- Learn more about DevOps
- Share your work with everyone
- Host your api to call from your apps
- Appreciate benefits you pay for when you other hosting services.



## Why Docker?


Docker containers wrap everything your application needs to run: 
 - code, 
 - runtime, 
 - system tools and
 - libraries.


## Docker vs Virtual Machine
- light weight vs heavy weight
- Metaphor: multiple shipping containers vs just one container on a ship


## Developer use cases


Onboard faster and stop wasting hours trying to set up development environments.


Spin up new instances and make copies of production code to run locally. Good for debugging.


Enable polyglot (full-stack) development and use any language, stack or tools without worry of application conflicts.


Eliminate environment inconsistencies and the "works on my machine" problem. 



## Why Traefik?

- Easy SSL
- Works with Docker containers
- Declarative style
